# Product-Detection-From-Grocery-Shelf
Computer Vision is been the challenging problem since last few decades , and one such extension to the computer Vision problem is the Object Detection problem and in this case study we will try to solve a application based problem where we need to detect the products in a given grocery shelve image by giving the output like a classical machine learning object detector which is (x,y) coordinates and height and width of the product, so that in the end we could get the bounding box printing on the image , and later the problem could be extended to product counting problem , as it is pretty clear from problem statement that we need to build high performance model using the state of the art Machine learning and Deep learning algorithms , we will be doing necessary analysis to get the insights of the data , we will be applying appropriate modeling techniques to build the robust model , we will apply some latest innovations in computer vision like Faster -RCNN , SSD , Efficient Det and at last we can employee the mAP as the base performance metric for the modeling.
